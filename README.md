# hello-world
Welcome to this repository

I have no clue what to enter here yet, but will introduce myself a bit to get started.

I am Polarw0lf and will remain anonymous for now. 
Originally from Europe, I identify as a global citizen.
As I write this I'm in my thirties, and have never really coded (although I did some HTML in high school).

However as I've gone through life I've also grown more concerned and motivated to be part of positive world change.
Change in society.
Change in climate.
Change in behavior.

I see our current 'civilization' as highly destructive, although I also see we have come far from years past.
As such, there's no reason to stop improving; we have a past where we have shown to be capable of this.

This brings me back to coding and why I've decided to pick it up.

Why... to change the world of course!
And I believe that this will be achieved best through advancing on the concepts behind blockchain.
And in order to be part of that movement; code I will.

Thanks for reading this far :)
If all goes well, you'll see much more of me coming by soon...
